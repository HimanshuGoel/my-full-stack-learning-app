## HTML

- HyperText Markup Language – HTML is the language that we use to create document that we want to share across the world wide we or more appropriately across the internet. HTML was created to share research documents which includes text, data, images, and all linked together.

- We should not have plan text into HTML it should be enclosed in some element like div or span.

- The doctype declaration let the client know which standards we are following.

- To enable the proper parsing, use doctype tag on first line of the HTML page. Specify the lang attribute for main language of the page it is important for screen reader. For proper parsing and rendering use http-equiv and content attributes.

- `<head>` tag is used for metadata information which includes title, meta elements, script, style, link, base. The link specifies the related documents and base specify base address for all relative links on the page.

- Block vs. Inline – Block elements are container for elements for grouping they can contain other block elements and in-line element example – paragraph. Block level element will start from new a new line.

- Use `&nbsp;` for telling browser, do not break at this particular point. So, when we resize the browser it will not break that words in between but it show it as a whole in any line.

- We used links to linking within a document or another document. Likes can be absolute or relative. If files on the server use absolute path, or if they in our local site content folder then use relative path.

- History of HTML5 – WHATWG accounted that it will no longer work on named versions of HTML so there will be no HTML6, HTML7, but the HTML spec is now a living standard. So HTML 5 no longer exists as new features are found in living standard.

![html-history](./assets/images/html-history.png)

- Standard Bodies for HTML – W3C, WHATWG, ECMASCRIPT

- Inbuilt APIs - Elements with API – canvas, audio, video, Forms element – meter, progress, math, data-list, New JavaScript APIs – canvas, web animations, Interaction, events and messaging APIs - battery status, clipboard API and events, cross document messaging, device and screen orientation, full screen, geo-location, media capture, notifications, touch events, vibration, Storage and files APIs – Blob URL’s File API, File Reader, IndexedDB, Local Storage, Real time communication APIs – Push API, server sent events, web sockets

- Fallbacks and Polyfills – fall back is to provide similar functionality as a native feature but maybe just with a different API. A Polyfills, on the other hand, is meant to replicate the exact same interface as well as functionality as how the native implementation would be built in the browser. For this use <www.html5please.com> website.

- Types of images

  - Vector – used for displaying simple images, and we can enlarge them without losing pixels. The image is made of a set of instructions of how to draw an image. It is rendered on fly when image is displayed.

  - Raster image – jpeg, png or gif. These are images with a set dimension where every pixel within the defined space of the image has a designated color. These are great for pictures but will lose pixels when enlarge. HTML5 canvas works upon raster images.

  - Canvas - it is just a drawing surface. We can draw shapes, apply colors and even manipulate images on the canvas. Due to rasterize nature of the canvas gives us a pixel by pixel control of that drawing surface. It uses underline grid system.

- Semantic HTML – mark-up that conveys meaning about its contents. It is mostly beneficial for the machines and also helps human too. Tags – small, footer, address. HTML mark-up is also used by search engines and screen readers and machine are not smart enough to understand the meaning of content.

- We should avoid using generic elements, inconsistent structure, presentational (CSS) mark-up into HTML. Like we should not use `<strong/>` tag just to bold a text, we should use it if we wanted to give text more important to other text. It should not use just for presentational purpose.

- Sectioning elements – elements whose intended use in to divide content up into logical sections like div, aside, article, section, figure, main, address, header, nav, footer

- To avoid CSS styles and JavaScript scripts to override our DOM subtree, The shadow DOM seeks to solve these systemic problems by creating an encapsulate spot to define our mark-up in CSS by creating a hidden and encapsulate subtree that is separate from the light DOM. Shadow DOM in native HTML like video, date, input type range tag. To see the shadow DOM, we need to enable setting `show user agent shadow DOM` in browser. Native elements already using shadow DOM.

- Shadow DOM alternatives – we have iframe but it is clunky to read, nondescriptive, excessive encapsulation, no clean API. We also have canvas but has accessibility issues, seo issues, can not easily compose, cannot extent existing elements.
  Shadow DOM encapsulates DOM subtrees and styles. Shadow DOM is like an iframe without all the baggage in a friendlier API

- Web real time communication lets us incorporate peer to peer video, audio and data communication in the browser without any plug-ins. Use cases and inspiration of WebRTC

![html-webrtc-use-cases](./assets/images/html-webrtc-use-cases.png)

- History of web

![html-history-of-web](./assets/images/html-history-of-web.png)

- What is WWW – is an information space where documents and other web resources are identified by URL in linked by hypertext links and can be accessed via the internet. The internet has been around since the 80s and the web has been around since the 90s.

![html-history-of-html](./assets/images/html-history-of-html.png)

- History of css

![html-history-of-css](./assets/images/html-history-of-css.png)

CSS is the styling mechanism for the web. It is a standard of selectors, properties and attributes. As it is just a standard so it doesn’t do anything, it just tells the people of created the web browsers how to interpret the CSS language and how to style HTML with it.

- History of JavaScript

![html-history-of-javascript](./assets/images/html-history-of-javascript.png)

- Html file naming conventions – always start with a lowercase letter, no special characters, no spaces, hyphens, underscores, or camel case can be used for file names with multiple word. Index.html is the standard name for a home page, browser looks for this name page to display as your lading or home page.

- HTML is made up of tags, tags tell the browser where an element should start and end. Tags should be lowercase, and each tag and its content is an HTML element.

- For checkbox and radio box, wrapped them into `<legend>` and `<fieldset>` tags

- Disabled field doesn’t get included into form data submit, but read-only field will be included. Generally, we use read-only if that user has filled its value in previous page and we don't allow to edit it on current page.

- ID vs Class attributes – use class attribute for styling instead of id.

![html-id-vs-class-attribute](./assets/images/html-id-vs-class-attribute.png)

- If images are deemed as part of the content, we should add it as HTML. If its is there for presentation and style, it should be added using CSS.

- The full form of SASS is syntactically awesome stylesheets.

- SASS has two different syntax, the original SASS syntax a bit different from CSS. It essentially removes the curly braces and semicolons from CSS, and it relies on white space. Because of this we can’t take a CSS spreadsheet and change the extension and treat it as SASS. So, for exiting projects with large CSS stylesheet porting to SASS is problematic. Due to this an alternative syntax has been developed by name SCSS. SASS is built on Ruby, LESS and Stylus built on Node.

- Responsive Page - text, images, buttons size become large/small, also page layout changes based on screen size changes. We can use media queries for it
- Cookies are just additional pieces of information that the server asks the browser to store and send back to the server with every request. But now local storage is preferred. These generally stores authentication and configuration related information which server needs to see in any request. In JavaScript object we can define properties that are functions, in JSON functions are not a legal property.

- Page request lifecycle: when we request a webpage in our browser, either by clicking a link to a new page or typing a URL in the browser. The server sends down the HTML to our page in the body of the response. Now after this browser has received the HTML it begins processing it. And part of that processing is to look four kind of different directions in the HTML i.e. CSS links, scripts tags of the source attributes, image tags, and font face directives in CSS rules. New requests were made based on these and response included their assets.

- App shell architecture – cached shell loads instantly on repeat visits, it is a main u ser interface for our application without any content. by this we can avoid showing black page while loading which frustrates users.

- We will use the service worker to cache the app shell. The cache API is a cache storage for requests and responses, it is a pre-requisite for service workers. It stores values in key value pairs, and available from window scope and service worker scope. Like below it will cache the entire request and response.

- Web worker – a script running int the background. It initiated from the main document, runs separately from main document and doesn’t have access to the DOM. It is often used as a programmable network proxy which lets you control incoming and outgoing network request. We can combine it with the cache API to serve requests from the cache. Specially if network request fails from server, it can handle it

![html-service-worker-life-cycle](./assets/images/html-service-worker-life-cycle.png)

- Web workers – it brings background threading as a first-class citizen to web browsers. We can splice an intensive process logic into a worker and it will run independent of the UI thread.

- Workbox caching strategies –

![html-workbox-cache-strategies](./assets/images/html-workbox-cache-strategies.png)

- Browser cache, if files are already in browser cache then it will not make request to sever for them. In application, all the cache files will be in grouped to a single manifest file. We should not mix browser caching and application caching. In browser, we can specify when a file will be expired, but in application cache we can only send updated files if we change the manifest file.

- Web storage comes in two flavour in local storage and session base. Security is per session and per domain. Capacity is between 2 to 10 MB. Web storage is client only (don’t need to send every time to the server) and larger capacity unlike cookies. It has simple API, key/value pair and widespread availability.

- Two types – dedicated (linked to browser that spawned the worker so it has a very tight relationship), shared (runs in the background and basically any script that’s running within that domain can send messages to that worker. It is largely unimplemented in browser currently.).

- The data which is stored in a sandbox so if website A creates it then it cannot be access by website B. local storage will work as session storage if working in private mode. Data is serialized to file system in a hard drive outside of the browser. It is synchronous.
- Browser represent a web page in memory is through the document object model.

- Using javascript we cannot set a class using .class, we need to use classList as class is a reserved word.
- To indicate emphasis use italic tag in the text, we can use `<em>` for meaning purpose and `<i>` for just styling purpose. So, use `<em>` not `<i>`, same with use `<strong>` not `<b>`.
- HTML is derived from SGML.

- Why should we structure our text – users can get to information quickly, enables accessibility tools to understand information, enables browsers to style the content, helps search engines to understand content.
- The term progressive enhancement refers to the use of newer features that add to the experience in modern browsers that support those features, but doesn’t detract from the experience in older browsers.
- URL part composition

![html-url-parts-composition](./assets/images/html-url-parts-composition.png)

## CSS

- types of selectors - The pseudo classes are just something that the browser will implicitly apply.

![css-types-of-selectors](./assets/images/css-types-of-selectors.png)

- The 1.0em; states for the size which is default to the page. If we say width: 50%; then it will be half of its parent width.

- We also have a star selector which matches everything on the page:

```css
* {
  color: White;
}
```

- Ordering rules – if two conflicting rules are coming from the same source it just uses the last rule.

- CSS Reset – it is a stylesheet that effectively override the default styles given by a web browser for all HTML elements. Because every browser has slightly different default styles, it will remove this different in style by making it all to reset. There are many available like from yahoo, meyerweb.com. we need to just give the reference of that stylesheet to our main page.

- Specificity – the higher is the specificity number the more important the rule is. It contains 3 parts ABC like below:

![css-specificity](./assets/images/css-specificity.png)

- Inheritance – some property values of an element will be inherited form the elements parents. Like text in div which is inside paragraph will inherit paragraph font size. But border, margin, paddings will not inherited form the parents. So, border set on paragraph will not have border on div or em or other tags inside it.

- Vertical margins collapse – when top and bottom margins meet they will overlap or collapse, technically the will overlap until one of the margins touches the border. But horizontal margins do not collapse.

- Width – when we specify the exact width it will specify of the content area. Any border, margin, or padding that we add will add to the width and require more space.

![css-width](./assets/images/css-width.png)

- Layout with CSS - default position value is static. it stacked up elements one after the other down the page. relative position moves an element from its default position in some direction. we can set the top and left properties values. fixed and absolute removes the elements from the flow of documents. Absolute position moves an element to a specific position relative to the body of the document the top and left will be consider from the body element. while fixed position is relative to the window itself. When we apply relative position, we can set top or left kind of properties on it, it is unlike the padding and margin. It will sit on top on the element instead of just pushing them around.

![css-position](./assets/images/css-position.png)

- Fixed positioning – it fixes the position of an element relative to the browser window. The element always stays fixed in place, even when scrolling. Generally, we use this in menu bar or navigation.

- Absolute positioning – it will not scroll with the browser window unlike fixed positioning. It takes an element out of the document flow, meaning the browser acts as if the element has no width and height, and the other elements on the page move up as if it was never there.

- By default, if the element is inside a container and we apply absolute on the element then it will relative to the body top left corner, but if we apply absolute on the container as well then it will be relative to that container.

- Relative Positioning - in this, other elements do not ignore its width and height. It doesn’t take out from the document flow. The original space will be maintained. The bottom: 0 value will make it to stay as it is because the bottom will be the same bottom of the element unlike absolute which will move it to the bottom of the window. And setting the position of the container element as relative does nothing at all unlike absolute positioning. If we have container with relative positioning and element as absolute, then the element will be relative to the container.

- Z-index – it allows us to control the stacking order of the elements. It will start from the negative value -1 and all the way up to highest z-index value.

- We should not have an orphan character on a new line, we can use typography module to make last two letters with “no break space” on every line.

- Instead of putting money to make UI better for older browser which market is going down, we should put it in the modern browser to make it better for future.

- Visual break points in Bootstrap

![css-bootstrap-visual-break-points](./assets/images/css-bootstrap-visual-break-points.png)

- types of selectors - relational, attribute, structural

- Relational selectors

![css-relational-selectors](./assets/images/css-relational-selectors.png)

- Other selectors

![css-other-selectors](./assets/images/css-other-selectors.png)

- Earlier we use table-based layout, then fluid-based layout came, now flexbox is the latest layout technique.

- The full name of flexbox is flexible box module, it is an extension of display property. It is a set of CSS properties to create flexible layouts and distributing extra space and aligning content. Because in CSS block, inline, table and positioning properties do not provide enough control for flexible layout, it becomes hacky and awkward to layout some more complex web applications which is why flexbox has been created.

- Flexbox is all about the relationship between a parent container and its direct descendant child items named by flex-container and flex-items. Flexbox was made for layout, float was not.

- Flexbox controls how items flow in one dimension, where the grid controls how items flow in two dimensions. Flexbox is great in handling alignment, distribution and order of content in space. CSS grid on the other hand is suited to lay items out in both dimensions. CSS grid, like flexbox, is all about the relationship between parent container and child items, grid-container, grid-items. It establishes a grid context for its children.

![css-flex-layout-vs-grid](./assets/images/css-flex-layout-vs-grid.png)

- Responsive web design is a technique for creating a website that adapts to accommodate various device widths. It involves Fluid Grid, media queries, flexible images.

- raster vs. vector images

![css-raster-vs-vector-images](./assets/images/css-raster-vs-vector-images.png)

- JPEG format usage: progressive JPEG means it will render with the lowest quality first then get improved over time, unlike normal JPEG which gets render line by line paint with full quality. It is a best format for photos, lossy compression and progressive.

- Other formats - GIF (now a days use in animation only), PNG (lossy compression not as much as JPEG, mainly used to allow transparency scenario), WEBP (created by google, animation and transparency, limited browser support), SVG (XML vector image format, points, lines, shapes, resolution independent).

- We use use SVG images wherever possible.

- Lossy optimizer and lossless optimizer: the lossless compression will remove lots of metadata/properties information from the file without affecting its visual quality unlike lossy which don’t remove the metadata info but other data related to visual looks.

- Use radio buttons for less than 5 options, use dropdown for more than 5 options.

- CSS is crafted to be simple, but scaling simplicity is difficult. It is Sass not SASS, full form is syntactically awesome stylesheets. Its extension is “.scss”.

- We should follow mobile first approach, then add media queries rules medium and large screen as required. So, we don’t have to add media queries in CSS reset and small screen. Due to this maximum CSS style rules will in small.css, then fewer in medium.css and few in large.css:

![css-mobile-first-approach-style-files](./assets/images/css-mobile-first-approach-style-files.png)

- In progressive enhancement we first apply rule for small screen then by media query apply rules for medium screen and then finally for large screen.

- Icons are vector based not pixel-based like the sprites, this means icons are very smooth specially on screens with high resolutions.

- Flexbox is a collection of CSS properties used to align content and distribute space. It includes concepts such as flex containers, flex items and flex lines. Flex containers control layout of child items.

- The flexbox model provides an efficient way to layout a line and distribute space among elements within our document. By this we can control the layout of children in a parent container. We can tell the children to line up left to right or right to left, or top to bottom or bottom to top, we can tell them fit on one line or wrapped to multiple lines. We can control the spacing around images and text and align the items either top or bottom. By this we can make responsive design much easier. We can use flexbox for creating an image gallery website.

- When not to use flexbox – they are good for simple layout where we can control over the components. But they are not meant for complex application grid systems. Better suited for individual components. So, should use more CSS grids instead of flexbox on entire page. Flexbox provide limited control over order. CSS grids provides better control over text layouts.

- The Origins of Styling Scroll - 1920’s cartoons are the earlier example of scrolling effect, often used when character was walking. In 1980’s video games used the same technique as cartoons but added triggers which increase interest. Web designers began using parallax scrolling in 2011, Early design used only 2 layers.

- Responsive design got started when Steve Jobs launched iPhone in 2007 with web browser. Four mobile strategy - ignore them, build a seperate mobile web site, build an app for the apple store, build a responsive site

- In 2007 iPhone release a phone in which he made the browser tell a lie to the website that it is having desktop size browser and then it shrinking the size to fit on the mobile, in other mobile on those days were not able to render complete website and making the website unusable. But as a responsive design now a days we want to know the actual size of browser on mobile not a lie, so we need to add below tag.

```html
<meta
  name="viewport"
  content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0. maximum-scale=1.0. user-scalable=0"
/>
```

- Pseudo classes allow us to conditionally select an element based on state or position, they start with a colon `(:)`.

- 12 column grid layout – it has history in newspaper because when we had multiple editions coming out in a single day, we need to lay them out quickly and 12 columns can easily be divided into halves, quarters or thirds. So, it is an easy layout to achieve.

- The `data-*` attributes on HTML allows us to store extra information on standard, semantic HTML elements without other hacks, such as non-standard attributes, extra properties on DOM, or Node.setUserData(). So, they are allows us to target javascript.

- By using forkJoin we can make two calls simultaneously, it is like q.all() functionality in promises, these calls will happen in parallel.

- Popover – It is like tooltip but gives us additional features like title. Tooltips are usually smalls, quick hints, and appear on hover. Popovers have an explicit title area and get additional related content. They are generally bigger and typically dismiss with click rather than hover status, popovers are more like a modal.

- Fonts of a typeface –

![css-fonts-of-a-typeface](./assets/images/css-fonts-of-a-typeface.png)

- Anatomy of typeface –

![css-anatomy-of-a-typeface](./assets/images/css-anatomy-of-a-typeface.png)

- Hyphenation – dividing words at the end of a line. Doesn’t look clean. No clear advantage. On digital application do not hyphenate.

![css-hyphenation](./assets/images/css-hyphenation.png)

- Don’t put indent first paragraph in digital world –

![css-indent](./assets/images/css-indent.png)

- Use all caps sparingly – instead of this try to use title cases

- Pull quotes – it should not be a copy of original text.

![css-pull-quotes](./assets/images/css-pull-quotes.png)

- Use maximum two different typefaces in the application like serif and sans-serif. Like one for header and another for content. We can use website fontjoy.com and fontinuse.com for font pairing.

- Font file types –TrueType (.TTF), OpenType (.OTF), Web Open Font Format (.WOFF), Embedded Open Type (.EOT)

- Pseudo-classes - :hover, :nth-of-type, :first-of-type, :last-of-type, :nth-child, :first-child, :last-child

- CSS grid properties –

![css-grid-properties](./assets/images/css-grid-properties.png)

- Building colors in RGB

![css-rgb-colors](./assets/images/css-rgb-colors.png)

- Different ways to represent colors – RGB, CYMK, HSL, HSV and Pantone. RGB rules the world.

- Choosing an image format (bitmap, tiff, compressed TIFF, gif, jpeg) only gif and jpeg can be used over the internet. Use gif for illustrations, logs and backgrounds and jpeg for photographs. We don’t use gif for photos because the compression would be lousy and if we use jpeg for illustration then its compression will be lousy.

- Portable network graphics (PiNG) because GIF compression was patented. PiNG (PNG) provides lossless compression means we can save it over and over again without losing information. JPEG still have smaller size than PNG. But PNGs don’t do animation. GIF and PNG can do transparency, JPEG cannot. Transparency allows the color of the parent layer to shine through. So, use PNG unless we are sure you need JPEG, JPEG compression is lossy, don’t use for working copies.

- Rater vs. vector based images – for vector we use .svg files -

![css-raster-vs-vector-images2](./assets/images/css-raster-vs-vector-images2.png)

- CSS filters – we can apply effects on images or other elements. Supported filters – blur, brightness, contrast, drop-shadow, gray-scale, hue-rotate, invert, opacity, saturate, sepie

- What is missing in CSS – no CSS constant and no cross browser supports, for this we should use SASS. SASS is the technology platform and SCSS is syntax. It has more features like nested style as below second one is more cleaner with SASS. SASS modules – color, list, map, math, meta, selector, string.

- Difference between without and with fluid container in flexbox – The grid will take all unused horizontal space.

- Theme colors –

![css-theme-colors](./assets/images/css-theme-colors.png)

## Angular

- Angular is a tool to help you build interactive websites, you can call it a framework. It provides tools to communicate with the server and to improve the performance, package application, maintain state, organize code/logic, ease display of data, synchronize state as it changes.

- Angular 2 is more standard based (modern web standards), modern (state management, change detection, etc.), more performant.

- Angular releases major version every 6 months, 6 months of active support and 12 months of LTS support (only security and bug fixes, no new features unlike active support).

- Universal benefits – reduction of cost, standards compliance, extremely performance, open source, use typescript, backed by Google, very uniformity (make onboarding new developers cheaper and simpler), amazing documentation.

- It indirectly provides environment for router, HTTP, forms, RxJS, etc. Already configured with Typescript no need extra to configure, opinionated means fewer decisions to take. Provides support for progressive web apps, lazy-loading, fully reactive forms library support, fully featured router, animations library, supports strictly typed forms.

- Angular also supports server-side rendering, mobile friendly, angular language service (Intellisense and better debugging in templates).

- Components – building blocks of modularity. It breaks up display of application in manageable chunks. It has display and logic.

- Services are a place to put logic which is not related with the display like checking more than article reading limit has been crossed or not.

- Directives are a way to give existing tag a new functionality like making elements or appear on hove, control the visibility, etc.

- Pipes is used, to format the data to display like uppercase.

- Modules are not optional in angular 14. It is a grouping of other features like services, components, pipe and directives, it can also include other modules.

- Application state gets changes on user interaction, http service response or by timer execution.

- Efficient change detection – first the state gets change then cascading changes occurs and finally re-render of page.

- Inefficient change detection – the system is not smart enough to identify the cascading changes and re-render the UI multiple times.

- Zone.js is a wrapper on the things which can change the state change like user interactions, http and timers, it knows when these things gets completed. Angular then subscribed to notification from zone.js so that it can run the change detection and re-render the display.

![Angular Zone](./assets/images/angular-zone.png)

- Rendering targets provided by angular – browser/DOM, server-side, native mobile apps, native desktop apps.

- Angular CLI solves JS fatigue problem which setting up the JS environment to build an application.

- Server side rendering – increase performance as initial download size gets reduced, increase render time, search engine optimization. Modes – full pre-render, dynamic pre-render, client-side switch.

- To build the native mobile apps with angular, there are two common tools ionic and NativeScript. For Native desktop, we need to use Electron.

- Angular testing utilities – TestBed – helpful in testing component with templates. It helps to constructs component in small, live, angular environment and gives us handles to wrapper around component and DOM created by its model. Async and fakeAsync, MockBackend.

- AOT – browser needs to compile the templates into DOM Functions i.e. the actual views. The AOT does it during the compile time itself.

- In chrome browser, Elements, console, sources tabs are called panel and windows inside each of them are called pane.

- In chrome browser, Use $0, $1, $2, $3, $4 to evaluate currently or previous selected elements from console.

- Angular 1 is an MVC pattern, but Angular 2 is component-based pattern, it is like a directive in angular 1 but smoother.

- The interpolation {{}} represents one-way binding.

- Using template reference variable to interact with child components – this variable allows us to specify a variable name that points to a component and then we can access any public properties and method on that component using that variable.

- Angular need to know the exact URL where our app is hosted, so that it can knows what its routes are relative to so that it can parse the URL. For this we need to provide the base tag in our index.html.

- Content project is an ability to change the content inside of a component based on the needs of the application. Like a dialog box and reuse it with different pieces of content for save and cancel button or re-posting logic. This is called transclusion in angular JS. In multiple slot projection we have more than one slot into which the variable content can go. We need to use ng-content tag which will tell angular whatever content exists inside of my component, put it inside of it.

- Mutability – objects and arrays in JavaScript are mutable; they can change any time without changing their identity. By default, angular only runs a pipe when the identity of the source has changed. Using impure pipes, it runs on every cycle of the change detection engine, this method of executing the filtering or sorting code every time change detection runs is how angular JS filter worked. Pipes are no longer recommended as the way to filter and sort our data. We should do it ourselves using component so that we can filter and sort the data when source gets changed by ourselves.

- We should not use global objects of third party services inside the application, if we do this then we won’t be able to use concepts ES6 modules, tree shaking, and also it is bad practice.

- Angular dependency injection lookup – whenever we provide a class into providers, angular takes it and provide an instance for that class using constructor function. In angular 1 we use strings to register the dependencies, in angular 2 we are using classes or types, that is our keys or in other words our token.

- Using OpaqueToken for dependency injection, angular 2 provide a mechanism for us to create a key or token that we can use in the dependency injector without creating a class. Its job is simply to create a token used for the DI registry in order to find the instance of the object we want.

- The useExisting and useFactory Providers – whenever somebody will ask for the MinimalLogger they will get the instance of the Logger, but they will see only those methods that are on minimal logger API that you actually want to use. useFactory allows us to parameterize the creation of an object. We use this when we need to have a very complex way to construct an instance of a class to use as a service.

- Angular HTTP testing utilities – HttpClientTestingModule, HttpTestingController. TestBed utility configures the environmental to run our unit tests, it also implements angular inject interface due to which we can inject the classes which we need in our test.

- For integration test angular use TestBed utility to construct the component, unlike unit test where we ourselves construct the component, in integration test angular does that using TestBed. It also constructs a module for us to be used in the test run for the component to operate in a realistic environment.

- Using a Testbed – Using fixture gives us a hold on the component, but not just its class with its method and properties but also its template, the actual HTML template. We can inspect the template, change it, ask angular to run change detection and expect, this is also a main benefit of testbed to able to get a hold of this fixture. Also using Testbed, we can setup the dependencies in a bit of an easier way. Testbed is also just an angular module.

- Using debug element – debugEl has a query method which we can use to select from the root node using “By” predicate.

![angular-debug-element](./assets/images/angular-debug-element.png)

- Tree shaking removes the properties and functions from production build code that is never called.

- Enable production mode by calling enableProdMode(), the development runs an extra step though angular 2 change detection process. When it’s all done running change detection, it runs it one more time to make sure that nothing has changed. So, in production mode we want to disable this feature.

- Ahead of time compiler (AOT) benefits – in this precompiling our application like compiling template. We need to install compiler itself from platform-server. With AOT we cannot use full path but relative path. It provides faster rendering, fewer requests, detect template errors, better security.

- Optimistic bundle download – eager lazy loading of the module. It will download it as soon as there is available download. We do not want to wait to render the application until it is downloaded.

![angular-preload-all-modules](./assets/images/angular-preload-all-modules.png)

- If we set schemas: [NO_ERRORS_SCHEMA], it means we are testing shallow components, so angular won’t give error any error as it won’t render the child components. In provider if we use useClass or useValue then while doing dependency injection it will pass the instance of that class or value.

- For change detection angular is used zone library, zone listen all the asynchronous activity in a zone. It has a queue of asynchronous activity that it listens for and it waits until it finishes. So we can utilize this concepts using testbed to be able to know when these asynchronous activity is finished versus doing a “done” call-back as in traditional approach.

- The nativeElement property exposes the regular old browser’s DOM API to work with template. There is an another property called debugElement() it is like nativeElement() and it has a way to access to root element of our template. It has some different set of functionalities that is very similar to nativeElement.

- To make the ngOnInit() method to get called as a lifecycle event we need to raise changeDetect() event. We can manually call ngOnInit() but it is not recommended approach.

- Using the fakeAsync helper function to avoid slowness and increase readability. We can use tick() function to call any code that should be called inside of that time-frame, then we can call our expect() statement. The reason we can do this is because angular itself runs inside of zone.js and fakeAsync function makes this code run in a special kind of zone, that zone.js will create that allows us to essentially control the clock inside of that zone. So, we can tell it to tick forward.

- Fake Async in the tests – we need to wrap the test in fakeAsync method, it allows us to fake time. Using tick() method to fake time while using fakeAsync. Working with Async – it helps us to wait for while selecting any DOM to do test deep / child component as integrated test. We use a method fixture.whenStable() for this type of testing.

- If we don’t know the actual tick times then use flush() it will make zone.js to run all the pending tasks in its queue.

- Using the async helper function – it works with promises. Promises are also asynchronous. It also utilizes the same concept of zone.js. it is also a part of angular core testing module. It will ask our component to wait until it has stabilized. The component understands when it sees a promise inside of itself that hasn’t yet been stabilized until that promise resolves. But async() doesn’t deal well with setTimeouts.

- fakeAsync can work with both a promise and a setTimeout and with all other asynchronous types of code. But async is only works well with promises. We should prefer using fakeAsync approach.

- Interceptors allows us to write a small bit of code figure in a single place and apply to all of the HTTP request and responses. They are like services and implement the HttpInterceptor interface. They manipulate HTTP requests before they are sent to the server. They also manipulate the responses before they are returned to our app. Uses for interceptors – adding headers to all requests, logging, reporting progress events, client-side caching.

- Types of directives – component, attribute directive, structural directive. An attribute directive changes the appearance or behaviour of a DOM element. It makes DOM more dynamic, responding to run-time environments and quick & easy to reuse.

- structural directives - `*ngIf`

- Pipes modify data for display only. types - async, currency, date, decimal, json, lowercase, percent, slice, titlecase, uppercase

- Query decorator - if template is inside view then use @ViewChild otherwise @ContentChild if template is inside component

![angular-query-decorator](./assets/images/angular-query-decorator.png)

- Directive selectors

![angular-directive-selectors](./assets/images/angular-directive-selectors.png)

- Native element using cautions – it tight couple our back-end code with front-end presentation, it is unavailable in angular universal, and we cannot move any logic directly using nativeElement into a web worker. So, if we use it property then these problems will not arise. For this we should use Renderer2 class.

- Building templates with ngTemplate – by default it’s just add an empty element as comment <!----> on DOM. We can also use it with ngIf-then-else condition:

![angular-ng-template](./assets/images/angular-ng-template.png)

- NgTempalteOutlet – by this we can decide the position of template to display on the DOM, other use-cases can be alternate UI, repeated UI elements, dynamic UI placement:

![angular-ng-template-outlet](./assets/images/angular-ng-template-outlet.png)

- ngTemplateOutlet Context: we can pass some JSON which will alter the templateOutlet, it is useful for simple template modification scenarios:

![angular-ng-template-outlet-context](./assets/images/angular-ng-template-outlet-context.png)

- Dynamic component creation - `*ngComponentOutlet`, `ComponentFactoryResolver`, `resolveComponentFactory`

- Use ng-container wherever possible instead of div or span.

![angular-ng-container](./assets/images/angular-ng-container.png)

- ngSwitch Bloat – instead of this use NgTemplateOutlet:

![angular-avoid-switch-bloat](./assets/images/angualr-avoid-switch-bloat.png)

- A pipe shouldn’t do a lot, for this a component will be a better choice. All built-in pipe are pure, except - splice, json, async

- A better ngFor while iterating collections using trackBy function so that while manipulating the collection angular don’t have to re-create it on the DOM

- Angular lifecycle hooks – the blue blocks hooks don’t available in directives only in components:

![angular-lifecycle-hooks](./assets/images/angular-lifecycle-hooks.png)

![angular-lifecycle-hooks-playground](./assets/images/angular-lifecycle-hooks-playground.png)

![angular-lifecycle-hooks-playground2](./assets/images/angular-lifecycle-hooks-playground2.png)

- Angular treats the UI as a DMZ, accessible to anyone untrusted and un-trustable. Angular treats all values as untrusted by default. Angular only trusts template HTML, binding expressions, and attributes. It will sanitize or cleanse any content it doesn’t trust before adding it to the DOM. It will still display it like a script by converting first into simple string text so that browser doesn’t parse it.

- View child - it is like getElementById() method.

- We can create three types of services to share the data – property bag, basic statement management of entities, and state management with notification. For advance we can use redux.

- For change detection we can use the timer pool if the property is not binding by angular expression:

```typescript
onOnInit() {
    timer(0, 1000).subscribe(t => {
        console.log(this.prod);
    }
}
```

- angular communication approaches

![angular-communication-approaches](./assets/images/angular-communication-approaches.png)

- Angular Material is a reference implementation of Google’s material design specification. It provides a set of reusables, well tested, and accessible UI components based on Material Design. It supports Asymmetric acceleration and deceleration which create more natural and delightful motion than symmetric motion:

![angular-asymmetric-acceleration-and-deceleration](./assets/images/angular-asymmetric-acceleration-and-deceleration.png)

- The goal of angular CDK is to give developers more tools to build awesome components for the web. This will be especially useful for projects that want to take advantage of the features of Angular Material without adopting the material design visual language.

![angular-flex-layout-model](./assets/images/angular-flex-layout-model.png)

- AOT Compiler – improve performance, earlier JIT process compile the functions in DOM functions it takes time. But now using AOT it directly sends the DOM function without compiler.

![angular-jit-process](./assets/images/angular-jit-process.png)

![angular-jit-process](./assets/images/angular-aot-process.png)

- We get the below CORS error unless the URL’s match, including the ports themselves:

![angular-cors-error](./assets/images/angular-cors-error.png)

- Pure and impure pipe performance – pipes are pure by default means they do not work with data mutation, they only get re-evaluated if the object reference got changes that the pipes is applied to. We can resolve this by making the pipe impure but it will impact the performance. Like even initial loading of page this sorting pipe will be called many times due to object changes

- While doing interpolation we can’t use assignments, it only allows read-only data.

- If we don’t want to use brackets () for event binding then we can prefix it by “on”, like on-click.

- Content projection is same as transclusion in angular 1.x, now we use term ng-content tag for it

- Lifecycle hooks - Constructor() – only dependency injection will happen in this step, ngOnChanges() – anytime an input property changes this lifecycle hook gets called, ngOnInit() – input properties have been initialized, ngDoCheck() – when we are working with change detection, when input property gets changes if we want to perform our own change detection, ngAfterContentInit() – when the components or directives content has been initialized, ngAfterContentChecked() – content has been checked out and we are being notified that the checking is complete, ngAfterViewInit() – when the components view has been initialized, ngAfterViewChecked() when view gets checked, ngOnDestroy() – gets called right before the instance gets destroyed and we can free up any resources we have.

- Module organization – Core module should contain single use classes or singleton for the entire application, it should be imported only once in app module. We should have one more module i.e. AppRoutingModule for containing routing related information. Shared module should contain modules which are re-exported and shared throughout the app.

![angular-module-organization](./assets/images/angular-module-organization.png)

- Unit Test – jasmine is main testing framework, and karma is the framework that executes our tests.

- If we want to take up the control while newing up the instance of the recipe class, we need to create a factory that will be executed to create a new service instance. By this we will have more control for how it is created:

![angular-use-factory](./assets/images/angular-use-factory.png)

![angular-use-factory2](./assets/images/angular-use-factory2.png)

- SkipSelf decorators to make sure it is properly checking for a separate input of the core.module. SkipSelf tells the injection system to begin looking for an existing instance of the module in the parent injector. Optional instructs the injector to pass in null if no other instance is found.

- The execution will become pause at the await keyword, so we need to use async keyword in function method name so that it will not block the caller of this function.

- RxJS is a library for building asynchronous applications with observable sequences. It provides an API layer which abstraction different implementation of synchronous, async, single value or multiple value responses. RxJS is written in TypeScript.

- Subscribe method returns a subscription object, by this object we can cancel the execution of the observable. When we cancel an observable by unsubscribing from it, we won’t get a completion message that can be handled by the completion handler we write, but tear down code will still runs when we unsubscribe to prevent the memory leaks in the code.

- Subjects and multicast, they enable multiple observers to receive values from the single execution of an observable.

- Subjects – they are observables. They are implemented as a child class of the observable class. They can also act as observers. They have a state and maintain a list of observers. Due to which they can push values to more than one observer at a time. This makes them multicast instead of unicast.

- Subjects are similar to observables but have a few important additional features. Observables can only produce values for a single observer, so they are unicast. Since subject can produce the same value for multiple observers, they known as multicast.

- Multi-casting operators – multicast() it takes subject as a parameter, it returns a connectableObservable type on which we need to call method connect(). The refCount() operator can be used with other multi-casting operators to automatically trigger execution of the source observable when the number of observers is greater than 0. The publish() operator is thin wrapper around multicast that doesn’t require us to pass it a subject. It will create one for us behind the scene. The share() operator is similar to using publish and refCount together.

- A scheduler controls when a subscription starts and when notifications are delivered. Observables can be configured with schedulers to control the execution context for the observable. Types – queueScheduler (for sync operations), asyncScheduler, asapScheduler (micro tasking).

- Schedulers give us control on how our observables are executing. queueScheduler, asyncScheduler, asapScheduler, animationFrameScheduler, TestScheduler.

- Understanding Schedulers and the Event loop: microtask queue has high priority than async task queue.

![angular-scheduler-and-event-loop1](./assets/images/angular-scheduler-and-event-loop1.png)
![angular-scheduler-and-event-loop](./assets/images/angular-scheduler-and-event-loop.png)

- Using flatMap to process inner observables – flatMap operator is more sophisticated than map operation, it will also subscribe to the returning observable and deliver it throughout the rest of the pipeline.

- In decorator we pass configuration objects that basically stores metadata, all this metadata is used to describe some object that follows like in below Class, Decorator is a feature of Javascript.

- RxJS is the reactive implementations of the Reactive Extensions API. The ReactiveX API is meant to help us to manage the flow of data in our app. RX is a combination of the best ideas from the observer pattern and the iterator pattern. The observer pattern – key things are subject and observer or observables and observers.

- Benefits of RxJS - It has a better asynchronous API, it has both readability and capability of handing multiple values. Callbacks, promises and async-await are only better for handing a single value.

- Libraries are supplemental pieces of functionality, they help us solve specific problems, but don’t dictate the overall architecture of our app. Ideally, they avoid conflicts with other libraries and let us selectively use their features as we see fit. Examples are RxJS, lodash, jQuery. Framework on the other hand are much larger and prescriptive. We typically only use choose a single framework to use when starting work on a new application, however we might supplement that framework with several libraries to help us with specific problems we are trying to solve. Example – angular, react, Vue.

- RXJS operators

![angular-rxjs-operators](./assets/images/angular-rxjs-operators.png)

- Types of observables – cold (Netflix / movie @ home) and hot (movie theatre)

- observeOn – use different scheduler as javascript has multiple queues. This operator explicitly let us specify which queue on observable will processed on, means it let us specify a priority for the new values coming out of an observable.

- subscribeOn – it is similar to observerOn, it changes observable scheduler used by source observable.

- Multi-casting - Taking values from source and sharing or passing them along to multiple subscribers, typically placing some type of control or limit on how the subscribers receive values or the values they receive.

- Core and shared module – core or common module is designed for singleton type of services, which will be shared throughout the service like logging service, error service and data service. Service that are specific to a feature can go in the feature’s folder. Shared folder should contain reusable components, pipes and directives like calendar component, auto complete component. Shared module will be imported many times in different modules, but core module should be imported only one time into root module.

![angular-module-organization2](./assets/images/angular-module-organization2.png)

- Change detection strategies – in case of container presentation pattern, we don’t want the child component changing the state of the data at all, because that is the job of the parent or container component. When using OnPush detectors, then the framework will check an OnPush component when any of its input properties changes, when it fires and event, or when an observable fire an event.

- Reference vs. Value types – if our container component passing a value type it would update the child because change detection mechanism would catch, but when we do changes in some object property i.e. referenced type because object itself didn’t change and change detection won’t get fire, so to handle this we need to use cloning techniques.

- State management options – angular service, NgRx, ngrx-data, observable store, Akita, Ngxs, MobX

- A service is typically a class with a narrow, well-defined purpose. It should do something specific and do it well.

- HttpClient and RxJS operators – use forkJoin when we want to call two HTTP service and know when both of them come back and completed, it is like promises.all.

- General architecture of application with libraries

![angular-general-architecture-with-libraries](./assets/images/angular-general-architecture-with-libraries.png)

- The best way to test our angular library is to use npm pack command which is used to change directory into the library dist folder. We need to type command cd my-folder/dist then npm pack. It will create a tarball file (`*.tgz`) then we can install it using npm install my-folder/dist/package.tgz. other alternatives to test the library on local are npm install, npm link, but npm pack is best approach.

- Push based architecture using RxJS and Facades. Traditional pull based – we call them once, they respond, they are done. They are not going to return values over the future. Push based services – we construct a stream like user stream using another stream that will extract our users out whenever that state changes. Our views react to that change of data from that stream.

- For a state management we need single source of truth, immutable state that is needed for things like ngOnChanges so it can fire properly as it will only get fires when the reference will change, state change notification and track state change history and simple to implement and maintain, works with any front-end framework. To satisfy all of these things we can use observable store. It provides a simple way to manage state ina front-end application while achieving many of the key goals offered by more complex sate management options

- NgRX selectors - allow us to query our store for data, recompute when their input change, full leverage memoization for performance, selectors are fully composable, selectors are extensible

- Jest is built on jasmine, it uses snapshot which reduce test code and compares results with snapshot. By this the snapshot gets checked-in into the PR which reviewer can see and take decision whether it is make sense for which we are making against take PR.

- Effects are about controlling asynchronous operations and allow us to dispatch action based on this asynchronous operations.

- NgRx is a library, it is not a framework or another platform. NgRx supercharges the redux pattern with RxJs.Redux pattern is a state management container, it came from React community. The reducer will take the slice of state from action and create a new state. We don’t put HTTP service in the reducer as HTTP service call is not a pure function, it is a side-effect as it can return anything. We use effect for this situation, this effect is listening for all actions that are being dispatched in our application.

- Redux attempts to make state mutations predictable by imposing certain restrictions on how and when updates can happen. Three core principles – single source of truth by one big store, state is read only, pure functions drive state changes

- For communication between components, we need to action and selectors. As one component raise the action then reducer update the store and both components subscribe to that select which will make the components re-render.

- Now we can use `changeDetectionStrategy` onPush, it will optimize our view performance. It means that the change detector’s mode will be initially set to CheckOnce. Any asynchronous API events like XHR or promise based events will not trigger change detection once we change to this strategy of OnPush and the components template will not get updated. In default strategy it will every time changes in our application as a result of any user events, timers, XHR requests, promises, etc change detection will run on all components.

![angular-without-change-detection-on-push-approach](./assets/images/angular-without-change-detection-on-push-approach.png)

![angular-without-change-detection-on-push-approach](./assets/images/angular-without-change-detection-on-push-approach.png)

- Now above component will be changed only if new input reference is passed or a dom event is raised in our component or its children otherwise the view will not get updated.

- Angular language service main features – hover tooltip (quick info), go to definition, code completion Intellisense, diagnostics, syntax highlighting. It will automatically shows the properties which are available if we type [], and available events if we type () on a `<div>` element. Angular language service is built on top of Language Server Protocol (LSP) which makes is editor agnostic.

- Benefits of rendering the application on server-side using Angular universal – show the first page quickly, improve performance, facilitate web crawlers (SEO).

- On console if we type ‘ng’ it will give us below methods –

![angular-ng-console-functions](./assets/images/angular-ng-console-functions.png)

- Angular CLI Builders - Builder are wrongly given name, they just know that they are just given a set of options, run a function and return the results.

- The term ‘state’ is kind of fancy term for saying the data in your application that changes like list of movies. A side-effect is a term that we use to describe code that has to talk to the outside world like making REST calls, handling a web socket connection or dealing with time, these side-effects generally triggered by like ‘search’ button call. The term state change is the act of after we subscribe and get the movie list result, we update that component is managing to the results that came back from the API request.

- Selectors are consumers of action, but their responsibility is to help you bind your state to your components, it helps to bind state to our components. We have actions as some kind of indirection that allows a component to talk to the store without actually having to directly inject the store. Selectors are just functions. Selectors are like Global @input() for our application. Components don’t know how that state is derived or where that state comes from, their only responsibility is to subscribe to those selectors to be notified when that data changes, using async pipe in template which will automatically subscribe to that observable and then unsubscribe when the component is destroyed.

- Actions are unified interface to describe events, it just have data, no functionality, has a minimum a type property, strongly typed using classes and enums. This is the main communication layer between so many independent pieces of the application. It is how components are going to be describing events, and it is what reducers and effects are going to be using to trigger state changes and to trigger side effects. Unique events get unique actions, actions are grouped by their source, actions are never reused. Mention what caused it to happen, and who produced it.

- Optimistic UI is where we remove the records from the UI at once by assigning some temporary ID and then after getting call from server we update it, it makes UI more user friendly.

- If a user goes away from the desk for couple of hour, to avoid the stale data we can use web-sockets which will dispatch method in our backend that can notify clients when changes to our data model occur, and then using NgRx effects connect to that web socket and map notifications coming out of that web socket connection into actions that can then go update state by this we are always getting a live UI.

- To implement session expire functionality that to show message like ‘this is going to expire after certain minutes of time’ we can do it by setting up an effect that on enter could run like every minute of five minute or every hour to re-trigger that HTTP request and rehydrate the store if we don’t want to go the web socket method.

- To clear the data if user logs out, we can trigger the logout action and trigger state change that could pass undefined to our reducer and have them all clear.

- Effects are where all our side effect producing code happens like showing alerts, starting timers, opening connections to web socket, making http calls.

- Instead of having one heavy reducer function, we should have smaller reducer functions to update just slices of our state.

- Actions are like gluten of the NgRx loaf. We use unified interface to describe events. The ‘type’ property is the name of that event and it needs to be unique across all the actions in our application.

- Selectors allows us to query our store for data, they are almost like our SQL statements from a database.

- Anyone below we can use in effects. Exhaust map will discard any additional emission until one that is currently working on is complete, it is like going to postoffice and the front person is taking too much time and leave in-between. switchMap is opposite of exhaustMap, it will cancel the current work if new effect comes up. mergeMap, exhaustMap and switchMap can lead to raise condition as they are either cancelling the requests or discarding the new runs so concatMap is the safest operator but there is risk of back pressure and it will keep the emissions in order, it will lead to bad user experience of waiting. It is like waiting in a queue to get food, and we will only get the food when priors persons received the food.

![angular-map-use-case2](./assets/images/angular-map-use-case2.png)

- Usage of RxJS operators in different scenario –

![angular-rxjs-operators-different-scenarios](./assets/images/angular-rxjs-operators-different-scenarios.png)

- takeUntil is like throwing a person out of lunch line but everyone else will just continue. exhaustMap is like no line will ever perform, if someone is buying a lunch the other will just went away from there and never comes back.

- We can use interval operators in scenario where we want to refresh a page within some duration. Also instead using the web-sockets we can use this to rehydrate our models.

- Monorepos – everything that belongs to a system should get in there and it should have one version for all of these libraries not different version for different libraries by this we won’t have version conflicts, no burden with distributing lists

![angular-monorepos](./assets/images/angular-monorepos.png)

- Earlier compiler used to build the packages also if someone changes something in a project file, but now ngcc compiler will compile the package separately to make the build process faster. No more JSON conversion of typescript components.

- Faster tests – smarter recompilation model, earlier using view engine it will compile all of the components between every single test execution, but with Ivy unless we use some override method it won’t compile all of the components.

- HttpBackend will be last interceptor –

![angular-interceptor-sequence](./assets/images/angular-interceptor-sequence.png)

- Firebase was initial created to integrate online chat functionality. Google acquired it into 2014. Cloud functions can be triggered from different firebase services, google cloud services or even third parties through web hooks.

- Types of errors – external (HttpErrorResponse), business side and internal (Javascript error).

- When an Angular application is started, the main.ts file is loaded first, here we bootstrap the root module i.e. app.module.ts. In this module, we specify a component as the bootstrap component and tell angular to load this component and all its dependencies at start up and register it’s selector app-root. Now when browser loads the index.html file, it knows what is app-root and render all the contents of this component.

- The Bazel compiler is a build system used for nearly all software build at Google. When you compile the code with Bazel Compiler, you will recompile the entire code base, it compiles only with necessary code. It uses advanced local and distributed caching, optimized dependency analysis and parallel execution. In short, it only rebuilds what is necessary.

- @Inject is a manual way of specifying this lookup token.

- Injector tree – an angular application is a tree of components. Each component instance has its own injector. The tree of components parallels the tree of injectors.

- How angular router works – runs the guards that are defined, resolves the required data, activate the angular components, manages navigation and repeats the steps

- Three types of data bindings – interpolation, event binding, property binding. Interpolation is a one way data binding.

- Angular does not have built-in two way data binding, however, by combining property binding and event binding we can achieve two way data binding.

- Inbuilt structural directives are `*ngFor`,`*ngIf` and attribute directives are `NgStyle` and `NgModel`

- The main.js file contains all the code in our application, the polyfills.js file loads all the polyfill script to make sure it can be compatible with all the modern browsers. The runtime.js loads all the other files. The syltes.js file loads the styles as the name suggests and vendor.js file loads all the imported libraries.

- The canLoad guards always blocks preloading, so if the canLoad guard is executed, preloading will not work. We can replace the canLoad guard with the canActivate guard, and the it works perfectly fine.

- React vs. angular - Are you type of developer who prefers guided path where everything is kind of inside of a box and works out of box then choose angular. If you like to deviate from certain patterns and build things your own way like routing and other things then react is suitable for you. So, it is more of the type of developer you are than technology.

- By using `ng serve` it run the application locally in memory by using web pack server. This server is not ideal for the production.

- Instead of using the nested subscriber we should use maps like switchMap, exhaustMap, mergeMap and concatMap they all internal use map operator it has a project function which will return whatever we return whichever we return from it. These above operators use flattening operators like mergeAll, concatAll, switchAll and exhaust so that they don’t return observable of observables but just a normal observable.

- We shouldn’t mock which we don’t own. For the external libraries we should write an adaptor and while writing the external integration tests, use that adapter along with external library.

- We can also store full page and resources locally by using application cache but it is deprecated now, we should now use the service workers and cache API to cache resources. The cache API is a cache object where request objects act as keys to their responses.

- Service workers are scripts that run separately from our web page, intercept network request so web developers can treat the network as an enhancement and contains certain events such as fetch, push and sync. It basically works as a proxy between the network and the browser and a work when we are offline or in the background even when our site is closed, so we can trigger events when our site is closed as-well. Alternative is application cache but it is complicated and has strict rules, inefficient with versioning, cannot update small areas. Due to this the web workers have been introduced in combination with Cache API.

- Service worker expands on web worker, this means that it has no access to the DOM, isn’t tied to a particular page and run on its own global script context, works only with HTTPS, run without a page and is event-driven, it also triggered again even when in inactive state.

![angular-service-worker-lifecycle](./assets/images/angular-service-worker-lifecycle.png)

- What Is an "App"? - Application Richness and Reachability evolution, native app like IOS has increased the richness but reduced the availability.

- Expectations from an app - findable on app store, icon on home screen, touch controls, works offline, receives notifications, background processing, access to hardware feature and sensors.

- The progressive web app is a thing that will give us both richness and reach without compromise.

- Attributes of progressive web app – responsive, work offline, native app-like feeling, fresh and safe, discoverable, re-engageable (push notification), installable, linkable (URL based).

- Baseline requirement for progressive web apps – site is served over HTTPS, pages are responsive on tablets and mobile devices, metadata is provided for add to home screen, the start URL loads while offline, first load fast even on 3g, site works cross browser, page transition don’t feel like they block on the network, each page has a URL.

- The smart component will pass the updated data towards the dumb components

![angular-smart-component-data-passing](./assets/images/angular-smart-component-data-passing.png)

- We should only use behaviors like logging in the tap operator, we should not use side-effects in it.

- It is safest default for flattening, hard to create leaks like mergeMap. We should use it for HTTP request that can be cancelled (GET) and great for reset, pause and resume functionality. We should avoid it with POST request while saving the data.

- Catch errors on observables with catchError – we can either throw an error or return a new observable based on some condition. We can also return the EMPTY observable.

- Difference between [] and {{}} bindings - We can’t mix [] and {{}} together on the same attribute. Angular will complain.. Property bindings are actually manipulating the DOM and they get to preserve data types. Curly brace binding is string interpolation of the HTML and always results in strings.

- It comes down to how they function. {{}} is basically a form of string interpolation. You should think of it as simply replacing the HTML string with the results of the binding, and then the HTML gets evaluated.

- Property binding, [], on the other hand, works differently. You should think of this as manipulating the DOM after the HTML has been processed by the browser.

- So the [src] binding actually manipulates the src property of the image object, and NOT the src attribute of the img tag.

- The difference between ElementRef, TemplateRef, and viewContainerRef with examples.

- Angular 2 we have structural directive which are indicated by the prefix `*` because it is changing the structure of our DOM.

- No more $apply, repeated digest cycles, no more watches, no more performance issues with digest cycle and watcher limits.

- @Injectable() is similar to angular 1’s $inject. Now in new case we are using a decorator.

- When we inject a service, angular searches the appropriate injectors for it. Angular 2 has a hierarchical DI system with a tree of injectors that parallel an application’s component tree.

- The great thing about the http object, the service that angular gives us, is when it gives us back the observable it will automatically unsubscribe when it is done. So we do not have to worry about cleaning up that particular one. If we create a manual observable and subscription, then we are going to have to clean up our own subscription.

- Types of guards – resolve, can activate, can activate child, can deactivate, and can load (can load is like can activate but it will not even go get the contents, html and the javascript until it get satisfied it is used in lazy loading).

- We can use tools like AOT, which is an angular tool to do ahead of time compilation that will use the angular compiler on the server to compile the template here and then send across the wire those compile templates. We will use things like tree shaking to shake out some of the dead code that we are not using. Use code splitting so we can split our bundles up in case we use eager or lazy loaded modules. Use bundling and minification. Angular CLI.

- RxJS subjects are like an observable, but they can multicast to many observers, they are like event emitters and they maintain a registry of many listeners or observers.

- Angular universal is a concept that because we are no longer tightly coupled to the browser, because we have this compiler, we can actually build our application, and then render it entirely in a server side. Render it without the browser context at all. In this angular give us single method within what’s called platform server that renders our application to a string. So, we import our root module, and then angular say render to string. We give it the context of the URL the user’s trying to load. Then we can cache, serve or sent the string to the other user.

- A decorator is a JavaScript language feature, the scope of the decorator is limited to the feature it decorates.it is always prefixed by @ sign. It needs to be define above the class signature with no semi-colon afterwards, it is like an attribute feature in other programming languages.

- Observables help us to manage asynchronous data; they treat events as collections. We can think it as an array whose items arrive asynchronously over time. As of now observables are not supported by ES6, angular currently use Reactive Extensions (RxJS) as a third party library for this.

- Observables allow us to manipulate sets of events with operators. Operators are methods on observables that compose new observables. Each operator transforms the source observable in some way. Operators do not wait for all of the values and process them at once. Rather, operators on observables process each value as it is emitted. Operator examples – map, filter, take, and merge.

- Bootstrap array - Every angular application should have one app module, and one app component, it should have one bootstrap component which will be loaded while opening of index.html main file. So, every application must bootstrap at least one component, the root application component. The bootstrap array should only be used in the root application module, AppModule.

- Declaration array – we use this to define the components, directives, and pipes that belong to this angular module. Every component, directive, pipe that we create must belong to one and only one angular module. Do not add other classes, services, or modules to the declarations array. All declared components, directives, and pipes are private by default. They are only accessible to other things in declared in the same module.

- Exports array – allows us to share angular module’s components, directives, and pipes with other modules. Never export a service.

- Import array – an angular module can be extended by importing capabilities from other angular modules. It allows us to import supporting modules that exports components, directives, or pipes. We should only import what this module needs. Importing a module does not provide access to its imported modules.

- Providers array – it can register service providers for our application. It allows us to register service providers at the module level. It is like the provider array of component, which register the service at component level. Any service provider added to the provider array is registered at the root of the application and is available to the any class, even classes in other feature modules. Do not add services to the providers array of a shared module. Instead of this we should build a core module for services and importing it once in the AppModule. Routing guards must be added to the providers array of an angular module so that router can use these services during the navigation process.

- If you have set of services that you want to ensure are loaded when the application is loaded, consider defining a core modules for those services. It should be imported once into the root module.

- Different types of modules which we can have: root application module (AppModule), feature modules, shared modules, core module, routing modules

![angular-for-root-vs-for-child](./assets/images/angular-for-root-vs-for-child.png)

- We need to use query parameters to retain the user setting when navigating to the different navigation. To define parameters that work across multiple routes. Like on product list user has some search data, then navigated to the details page then coming to the product list page. Just like optional parameter we use query parameters to pass optimal or complex information. Unlike optional parameters they can be retained across routing paths. Like optional parameters, query parameters are not part of the route configuration and are not involved with matching route paths.

- We can use child routes to display routes within other routes for better route hierarchy, encapsulate and navigate through our application. Also makes easier to lazy load routes.

![angular-lazy-loading-vs-preloading](./assets/images/angular-lazy-loading-vs-preloading.png)

- A form model is the data structure that represents the HTML form – it retains the form state, form value, child controls.

- Creates a FormArray – we can call above created method to create multiple instances of that FromGroup, but we need somewhere to hold these multiple instances, that is the purpose of a FormArray. This array is simply a group of FormControls or FormGroups that are conceptualized as an array. These arrays are great for sets that are dynamic, or of unknown length.

- Building angular – during development time we are more focused on development speed and debugging and efficiency. In production we want to make sure the code is rock solid and secure and as fast as we can get it, even into the bundles/chunks.

- Ejecting – the angular CLI uses web pack under the covers and there is a configuration file to change the web pack configuration using command ng eject. By this we can eject our application and put proper web pack configuration so that we can run thing on our own, we would not be able to use ng build command anymore. Now a new file will be visible by name webpack.config.js. Now we can use npm start.

- When we use a form tag in an angular template, angular 2 is going to add a directive automatically to this form. We access a directive with a template reference variable. We need to have name property on an input field to make it register into angular with ngModel. We should also turn off browser validation to avoid inconsistency while handling error in browser validation using novalidate attribute in form tag.

- There is no guarantee that our model is set up when the blur or change event gets fire, so model might not be updated at that time. So instead of passing the $event model, we should use template reference variable.

- In earlier days while using cookie, another website open in different tab can also access the cookies for first tab. But using token-based protocol like OpenID connect or OAuth 2 it will require to put the token into the authorization header.

- For authenticating the user, we should use a separate server i.e. identity provider. Identity provider are also called SSO server.

- The OAuth access tokens have a fixed expiration time. If they got expired then calling a protected API result in 401 unauthorized. In this case we need to obtain a new token from STS to continue calling API’s. we can’t use OAuth 2 refresh tokens with Implicit Flow.

- Because all browsers do not support the newest version of javascript due to which we will use typescript. It transpile and change into javascript. We can let the browser let the transpile or we can transpile on server.

- Portal CDK – portal outlet - a portal is a piece of ui that can be dynamically rendered to an open slot on the page. this ui can be a component or templateRef. the open slot is a portalHost. tabs, dialog and snack bar uses the portal components. use domPortalHost to attach for an arbitrary DOM element outside of angular application context.

- Reactive extensions were originally developed by Microsoft as Rx.NET. It is a way to observe and react to data as it flows through time. Reactive development is a declarative programming paradigm concerned with data streams and the propagation of changes.

- For data caching we can use shareReplay and share operators.

![angular-life-cycle-steps](./assets/images/angular-life-cycle-steps.png)

- Angular is a tool to help you build interactive websites, you can call it a framework. It provides tools to communicate with the server and to improve the performance, package application, maintain state, organize code/logic, ease display of data, synchronize state as it changes.

- Angular 2 is more standard based (modern web standards), modern (state management, change detection, etc.), more performant.

- Angular releases major version every 6 months, 6 months of active support and 12 months of LTS support (only security and bug fixes, no new features unlike active support).

- Universal benefits – reduction of cost, standards compliance, extremely performance, open source, use typescript, backed by Google, very uniformity (make onboarding new developers cheaper and simpler), amazing documentation.

- It indirectly provides environment for router, HTTP, forms, RxJS, etc. Already configured with Typescript no need extra to configure, opinionated means fewer decisions to take. Provides support for progressive web apps, lazy-loading, fully reactive forms library support, fully featured router, animations library, supports strictly typed forms.

- Angular also supports server-side rendering, mobile friendly, angular language service (Intellisense and better debugging in templates).

- Standalone component doesn’t reduce work, but just reduce the learning curve for the new person learning angular, need to see what emerges further (new use cases).

- Tools provided by the Nx – ESLint, Cypress, Jest, Storybook, Prettier.

- Note that if your component has no inputs or you use it without providing any inputs, the framework will not call ngOnChanges().

- ngDoCheck - This hook can be interpreted as an “extension” of ngOnChanges. You can use this method to detect changes that Angular can’t or won’t detect. It is called in every change detection, immediately after the ngOnChanges and ngOnInit hooks. This hook is costly since it is called with enormous frequency; after every change detection cycle no matter where the change occurred. Therefore, its usage should be careful to not affect the user experience. Well, since Angular tracks object reference and we mutate the object without changing the reference Angular won’t pick up the changes and it will not run change detection for the component. Thus the new name property value will not be re-rendered in DOM. Luckily, we can use the ngDoCheck lifecycle hook to check for object mutation and notify Angular.

- ngAfterContentInit - This method is called only once during the component’s lifecycle, after the first ngDoCheck. Within this hook, we have access for the first time to the ElementRef of the ContentChild after the component’s creation; after Angular has already projected the external content into the component’s view.

- ngAfterContentChecked - This method is called once during the component’s lifecycle after ngAfterContentInit and then after every subsequent ngDoCheck. It is called after Angular has already checked the content projected into the component in the current digest loop.

- ngAfterViewInit - This method is called only once during the component’s lifecycle, after ngAfterContentChecked. Within this hook, we have access for the first time to the ElementRef of the ViewChildren after the component’s creation; after Angular has already composed the component’s views and its child views. This hook is useful when you need to load content on your view that depends on its view’s components; for instance when you need to set a video player or create a chart from a canvas element

- ngAfterViewChecked - This method is called once after ngAfterViewInit and then after every subsequent ngAfterContentChecked. It is called after Angular has already checked the component’s views and its child views in the current digest loop. If we continue clicking on the Update button many times, the ngAfterViewChecked will be triggered each time, as well as, ngDoCheck and ngAfterContentChecked.

- Note that the ngOnDestroy is not called when the user refreshes the page or closes the browser. So, in case you need to handle some cleanup logic on those occasions as well, you can use the HostListener decorator

```typescript
@HostListener('window:beforeunload')
ngOnDestroy() {}
```

- We can understand the lifecycle hooks by splitting the process into two steps,” first-time hooks”, and “in every change detection cycle hooks”. “first-time hooks”, the triggered hooks are: onChanges, onInit, doCheck, afterContentInit, afterContentChecked, afterViewInit, afterViewChecked. “in every change detection cycle hooks”, the triggered hooks are: onChanges, doCheck, afterContentChecked, afterViewChecked.

![angular-lifecycle-hooks-workflow](./assets/images/angular-lifecycle-hooks-workflow.png)

- How the Angular Compiler Works - The Angular Compiler (which we call ngc) is the tool used to compile Angular applications and libraries. ngc is built on the TypeScript compiler (called tsc) and extends the process of compiling TypeScript code to add additional code generation related to Angular’s capabilities.

- Angular’s compiler serves as a bridge between developer experience and run time performance: Angular users author applications against an ergonomic, decorator-based API, and ngc translates this code into more efficient runtime instructions. In this way, ngc can be considered an extended TypeScript compiler which also knows how to “execute” Angular decorators, applying their effects to the decorated classes at build time (as opposed to run time).

- The ngc has several important goals: Compile Angular decorators, including components and their templates. Apply TypeScript’s type-checking rules to component templates. Re-compile quickly when the developer makes a change.

- TypeScript by itself has no understanding of Angular template syntax and cannot type-check it directly. To perform this checking, the Angular compiler converts Angular templates into TypeScript code (known as a “Type Check Block”, or TCB) that expresses equivalent operations at the type level, and feeds this code to TypeScript for semantic checking. Any generated diagnostics are then mapped back and reported to the user in the context of the original template.

- Angular CLI works fine with either one: kebab case or came case. For my part, in the future we should try to stick to kebab-case because that is what the Angular CLI --help output uses.

```shell
ng new my-app --create-application=false | ng new my-app --createApplication=false
```

## Soft Skills

- LinkedIn - A place to find and be found. Profile pic should be a head shot with proper background color.

- 5 parts of formula for more effective message – don’t have the long paragraph. Next step is phone call, over the email, or face to face meeting.

- As an interviewer we also need to sell the opportunity like the projects, team, company, perks, contribution impact, preparation, promptness, attitude and vibe, our stories.

- Interviewee’s tell their experience in stories, concise answers, thoughtful questions, choice of words, body language and kindness.

- Don’t ask many yes / no questions but open-ended questions like “tell me about a time when,”, “tell me more about that project” or “how you solve this problem”.

- We can ask the complex problem they have worked upon, any new technology how they will learn, any project or shared code or ask for any homework. And then ask questions based on that homework. We can first have panel interview then give homework then call.

- Interview questions -

  - how many technologies you have worked and how much you would rate each of these?
  - which languages are you proficient in and could teach others?
  - tell me about the users you have worked with? what do your users do that make you upset
  - how long have you worked with this language? what are the best and worst changes you have seen since started
  - if you were asked to present to a group of engineers about a particular technology, what would you present?
  - what technical projects do your do at home
  - if you had more time what technology you would study
  - what do you think of working with older technology
  - when you are learning a new technology, what process do you use to bring yourself up to speed
  - what do you do when you see a colleague is approaching a problem the wrong way? let them do it and learn, or...?
  - do you read books? what are the last three books you have read?

- Illegal questions – age, religion, arrested, married, children, weight, personal finances, alcoholic, health, nationality, disabilities, military discharge.

- Enunciate – speak the words clearly.

- Key elements of a email – subject, introduction, the message, call to action (last part of the body), email signature.

- We should avoid using BCC feature, but we can use it to hide addresses from the recipients. If you are BCC recipients then you should not reply to that email.

- We should avoid underlining and italic, but can use bold and yellow highlighting. Some emoticons fine but don’t overuse. Also, use bullets points. Do not change background, use default white.

- Try to avoid acronyms.

- In capitalize title casing the connection words should be lower case i.e. a, an, and, at, by, for, in, of, on, or, the, to, etc.

- Animals names should not be capitalized or foods.

- We can use parenthesis to add additional information in a sentence. Dashes better at interrupting and emphasizing an important point. Colons indicates what follow is an explanation, a description or a pertinent list of items.

- Use semicolon when comma is insufficient but colon or period is excessive. It serves the same function as an audible pause when speaking.

- We should try to use active voice instead of passive voice, as active voice is less wordy and more clear. But if the action is more important than subject then we can remove the subject from the sentence like “by the team” in below passive example. Passive voice is often preferred in scientific and technical writing.

- Try to avoid overused and unclear words – almost, basically, different, feel, good, just, large/small/long, never, new/old, very/really, thing(s). instead of using them, we should be more precise.

- It is the editing and proofreading the text which separates from the bad writer.

- High performance consultant would often arrive the next day with a solution to a problem that he’d managed to solve at home the night before.

- A consultant who handles this competence with difficulty, takes on too much and then finds it hard to admit that the workload is too much for him.

- Whether you are young professional, a student, or a CEO, understanding yourself is critical for becoming a better professional. It will help you enhance your strengths and improve your weakness to make you a better boss and a better colleague.

![soft-skills-johari-window](./assets/images/soft-skills-johari-window.png)

- Values act as our personal compass, helping us to navigate choices and decisions, both personally and professionally. Values are formed by your life experience.

![soft-skills-4-factors-of-trust](./assets/images/soft-skills-4-factors-of-trust.png)

- Credibility is essential for hiring, promoting and trusting people. Those who end up establishing expertise are confident about showcasing their qualifications and achievements. The more we care about the success of others around us, the more they will trust us, paving the way for collaboration.

![soft-skill-trust-factors](./assets/images/soft-skill-trust-factors.png)

- Just being chatty is not same as being open. The attributes of openness are vulnerability, transparency and maintaining confidentiality.

- If we do something extra over and beyond which we normally do early on that will help us build the trust, then we can reap onto it rest of the time of the relationship.

- Rebuilding credibility and reliability – coming to a meeting prepared, putting your point across and taking notes to share with other are great steps to rebuild credibility, be more knowledgeable, communicate confidently. For reliability, be punctual, dependable, consistent with action, avoid last minute surprises.

- Rebuilding openness and self-orientation – should have candid conversations about feedback or misunderstanding, give help people in small ways, be interesting in entire person (hobby, past things).

- Put yourself into other person shoe to reduce self-orientation, be fully present while listening.

- Teams Calling - It uses phone system technology and PSTN to call internally and externally.

## Architectural

- We should use arrows one way and two accordingly and shapes doesn’t represent any meaning, we just need to be consistent in shapes.

- We should have a key section to define the meaning of different attributes used in the diagrams

- We describe the following levels and diagram names:

  - Level 0 — Business Capabilities Diagram: The key audience is business executives and non-technical stakeholders.
  - Level 1 — Technology Capabilities Diagram: The key audience is CIOs, CTOs, CISOs and Strategy & Planning managers.
  - Level 2 — Architecture Diagram: The key audience is Designers and Project Managers.
  - Level 3 — Design Diagram: The key audience is coders, testers and architects.

- Five architecture diagrams types

  - Application Architecture Diagram
  - Integration Architecture Diagram
  - Deployment Architecture Diagram
  - DevOps Architecture Diagram
  - Data Architecture Diagram

- The Flow Diagram - This diagram illustrates the moving parts in a business process.

![architectural-flow-diagram](./assets/images/architectural-flow-diagram.png)

- The Persona Diagram - It is important to show that your architecture solves the business problem. A persona diagram describes a chronological view and actors in a particular workflow. This is your best tool for proving that you’ve taken the business into consideration when developing your solution.

![architectural-personal-diagram](./assets/images/architectural-personal-diagram.png)

- The Infrastructure Diagram - The purpose of this diagram is to show what has been built and how the system currently works. Consider this a blueprint of the application you built.

![architectural-infrastructural-diagram](./assets/images/architectural-infrastructural-diagram.png)

## Mongo DB

- BSON - MongoDB represents JSON documents in binary form called BSON internally. It enriches JSON with additional data types that Mongo uses like Object Id, date, etc.

- Mongo DB is schema-less. Mongo does not enforces a schema, but documents inside the same collection should have a similar structure for consistency.

- The find() method returns a cursor to the documents that match the query criteria. In projection, 1 means inclusion and 0 for exclusion.

```shell
db.aircraft.find({}, {model: 1, range:1, _id: 0})
```

- Cursor - A virtual object where MongoDB stores the documents returned by the find method. It can have any methods like below -

```shell
db.aircraft.find().pretty()
db.aircraft.find().count()
db.aircraft.find().skip(3)
db.aircraft.find().limit(5)
db.aircraft.find().sort({model: 1})

```

- Mongo DB does not guarantee the order of the returned documents unless sort() method is used. 1 for the ascending order and -1 for descending order.

- The find() method returns a cursor, however the findOne() method returns an actual document. If no document match the criteria, the method returns null.

- Best Practice - We should pass an empty object to find() method when we want to return all the documents instead of using blank find() method -

```shell
db.aircraft.find({})
```

- Comparison query operations - $eq, $ne, $in, $nin, $lt, $lte, $gt, $gte

```shell
db.aircraft.find({model: 'Boeing'})
db.aircraft.findOne({model: 'Boeing'})
db.aircraft.findOne({model: {$ne: 'Boeing'}})
db.aircraft.findOne({model: {$in: ['Boeing', 'Airbus]}})
db.aircraft.findOne({model: {$in: [/^A/]}}) // using regular expression

```

- Logical Query Operators - $and and $or.

```shell
db.aircraft.find({$and:[{capacity: 124}, {range: {$gt: 6000}}]})
db.aircraft.find({range: {$lt: 600, $gt: 6000}}) // short-hand syntax if same field
```

- CAP Theorem - consistency, availability, partition tolerance (system won't fail). MongoDB supports consistency and partition tolerance.

- Types of NoSQL databases - relational database, document database, key-value databases (Redis DB), white-column stores (Cassandra DB), Graph Database

- MongoDB is a document database.

- Why use MongoDB - open source, document database, high performance, rich query language, high availability, horizon scalability.

- JSON is a UTF-8 String but BSON is a Binary. JSON is human and machine readable but BSON is a machine readable only.

- We cannot replace the `_id` value with another value.

- MongoDB is a case-sensitive language. It supports MongoDB query language (MQL). It has dynamic JSON based schema unlike predefined in MySQL. It has no foreign keys or joins or triggers. It follows CAP theorem not ACID properties. It is horizontal scalable unlike SQL which have vertical scalable.

- Which is best database - is your data structured or unstructured? preferred scalability strategy? No need for ORM (object relational mappings) with MongoDB.

- There is no schema enforcement from MongoDB, it is a application responsibility.

- Replicate sets - Minimum replica sets in MongoDB - primary db (only writable instance), secondary db (read-only instances, data is replicated from primary db) and arbiter db (no data, provides additional vote to elect the db in-case if primary gets failed).

- By using the BSON and memory mapped files concept to store the data, makes the MongoDB very fast and efficient.

- The `_id` can contains any type of data except array.

- The ObjectId() will return a new object id and it also contains a timestamp ObjectId().getTimestamp() in ISODate format. We can use it for sorting in created by format.

- MongoDB uses a cursor to support the efficient retrieval of the document as documents might be in huge number which might support the memory to load. By this, it will give you a batch of documents and close the connection.

- We can use index to speed up the queries. The scanning of each location on the disk is bad for performance which finding a record, the solution is to use an index, it basically holds mapping to those locations from field values. By this, we can jump directly to the disk location where document is stored is good for performance and less i/o operations. It also good for sorting performance purpose as-well. Without index it will show n number of objects has been scanned, after index it will show 1 number od object has been scanned. Index on the `_id` field can not be dropped.

- Index types - Regular (B-tree), Geo (sort nearby locations), Text, Hashed, TTL (expiration date for documents)

- To know about how MongoDB will find the document, we can use explain() method -

```shell
db.animals.find({name: 'cat}).explain()
```

- Covering index - we use query using index and all the information is with index itself then there is no need to go to the dist to get the actual document, we can use the index itself to the actual result. In the explain() it will say indexOnly as true. Suppose we have applied index on name field and returning only the name field, not even `_id`, then the covering index will be used.

- When our database is large, we can create index in the background so that read and write action won't get blocked.

## Miscellaneous Technical

- Engineers used to give complex names for the technology but under the hood it is very simple and have same base concept.

- JWT has three segments, each separated by dots. If it is a base64-encoded JSON then its first two segments would start from characters “eyJ” because when decode it becomes base64({“). First part it has Header that describes the token itself and how to read & validate the token. It has properties like type, alg and kid. The second part is the payload, it is the content of the token itself. It contains claims about the entity. The final part is the signature value, it is created using the header, payload and signing key. Its length varies based on the algorithm and key.

- The JWT pronounce as “jot”. It is originally created by the OAuth working group due to demand for JSON representation of claims and to replace SAML assertion.

- When to use JWTs – for API access, for information transfer (identity token), security proofs. We should always use JWTs in combination with something else like OAuth or Open Identity Connect protocols where rules are defined and low risk of misuse.

- JWTs are not a replacement for cookies and sessions. Browsers cannot maintain JWT sessions, we have to implement token storage and management. There is no out-of-the-box method to invalidate a single JWT.

- We should not store application or permission data as we should keep our JWTs small as it can easily hit header size limits.

- JOSE (JavaScript object signing and encryption) standards – JWON Web Tokens, JSON Web Signature, JSON Web Encryption, JSON Web Key, JSON Web Algorithms.

- Initial format check of JWT - three sections, two dots, base64url data, valid JSON objects.

- We should first validate the token like checking the issuer, subject value, audience, expiration date, before parsing it.

- JWE has 5 distinct section instead of 3 of JWT –

![misc-technical-jwe](./assets/images/misc-technical-jwe.png)

- When to use JWE – if we use PII (personally identifiable information) like names, email address street address, IP address, account number, telephone number etc., if token needs to be passed through multiple systems (including the 3rd party).

- It is short for YAML aren’t markup language. It is human-readable data serialization language. It can be used to keep and transfer the data. Its most common purposes is the configuration files. It is a true superset of JSON.

- YAML use cases – cross-language data sharing, configuration files, log files, object persistence, working with language like ruby, python, etc.

- It has two style – block (human readable) and flow (less human readable like JSON)

![misc-technical-block-vs-flow-style](./assets/images/misc-technical-block-vs-flow-style.png)

- Building blocks – sequence (arrays), mapping (key-value) and scalar (string, number, boolean and dates). We should do indentation with spaces not with tabs.

- For list we need to use (-) and for key-value we need to `(:)`.

- Scalar values – with string values we can use quotes or without quotes. By using the `#` we can add comment.

- One YAML file can contain multiple documents. The documents can be separated by 3 hyphens (---).

![misc-technical-yaml-key-value-and-array](./assets/images/misc-technical-yaml-key-value-and-array.png)

![misc-technical-yaml-nested-array](./assets/images/misc-technical-yaml-nested-array.png)

![misc-technical-yaml-nested-mappings](./assets/images/misc-technical-yaml-nested-mappings.png)

- Explicit typing – by using like !!str is an explicit typing which will convert the date into a string type.

![misc-technical-yaml-explicit-typing](./assets/images/misc-technical-yaml-explicit-typing.png)

- Repeated nodes – to avoid code repeat.

![misc-technical-repeated-nodes](./assets/images/misc-technical-repeated-nodes.png)

- Processing of YAML –

![misc-technical-processing-of-yaml](./assets/images/misc-technical-processing-of-yaml.png)

- YAML vs. JSON – YAML is standard for configuration and JSON is standard for service API.

![misc-technical-yaml-vs-json](./assets/images/misc-technical-yaml-vs-json.png)

- YAML vs. XML

![misc-technical-yaml-vs-xmsl](./assets/images/misc-technical-yaml-vs-xmsl.png)

- GitLab is a single platform that provides entire DevOps toolchain for organizations of any scale and size.

- A pipeline contains below things – jobs, runners, stages

- To create table of contents from headings automatically, we can use [[_TOC_]] syntax.

- Github is a cloud based git repository hosting service.

- We can run a workflow on any Github event –

![misc-technical-github-events](./assets/images/misc-technical-github-events.png)

- WordPress is an open-source, free platform for building and developing websites. WordPress is the most user-friendly and efficient blogging and website builder on the market right now.

- Anonymous comments can cause serious damage to your website’s reputation.

- WWW or no WWW – whether your website is brand-new or has been hosted for a few months already will depend entirely on its stage. If it brand-new, you must definitely choose whether to use www or non-www in the URL of your site.

- One calorie of heat energy is the amount of energy that is required to raise the temperature of 1g of water from 14.5 degree Celsius to 15.5 degree Celsius.

- Temperature is defined as a parameter that helps us define the level of hotness or coldness of its body.

- The quantity of heat that is absorbed by a body is generally dependent on three factors, which are as follows – mass, increase in temperature, material.

- Not all the materials can have transfer of heat through this process, for example, plastic. Such material called insulators. Conductors are known to carry heat easily because of their low specific heat capacities.

- The process of heat transfer through a vacuum is called radiation.

- Motion is a combined outcome of a body under observation and the observer.

- Magnetism – The core of the earth was made from iron, while the planet itself was a magnet, which he quoted to be the reason for compasses to point to the north. The unit of the strength of a magnetic field is Tesla. Magnet types – permanent, temporary and electromagnets. A current-carrying wire produces a magnetic field around it. Magnet uses – scrap lifting, surgical extraction, dc motor, ac generators. The payment card strip is made of magnet, audio cassette, CRT’s monitor, speaker system. Over-exposure to static magnetic fields can be harmful to our health.

- Skill transfer is very easy in angular, as most of the angular projects looks the same. When you use angular, you are getting everything like route, forms package, http package, there is a kind of prescribed way to code with angular but products like react are much more pick and choose, so you can choose which router you want, which http package you want to use.
By low-code we can deliver better software faster. One way is to abstracting automating things so professional developers can go faster. It also takes the constraint away from people who can only build that and it open an ability to adapt to this new world in real time with people who has no traditional skills in software development. It provides speed, simplicity, no huge army of engineers and get live quickly and save tons of the cost to the business, anybody can develop software, business and IT will be on same page by providing common language, has guidance and guard rails, no long red tape of processes.

- Chrome dev tools - Elements, console, sources tabs are called panel and windows inside each of them are called pane.

- Time begins on 1st jan 1970 with the unix epoch, when we say Date.now(), it gives milliseconds from this time.

- IDE’s Evaluation - vi -> emics -> vim -> neo vim -> nano -> notepad++ -> Dreamweaver -> visual studio code -> visual studio -> WebStorm (features looks more reliable and polished than vs code)

- Choosing the framework depends whether website mostly have static content or highly interactive, if highly interactive then whether it needs SEO, if SEO and content rarely change like in blogs website then use JAM stack and pre-render the content and cache on the CDN. if dynamic content then need full SSR + hydration.

- Angular bootstrap process - angular.json (main) -> main.ts (bootstrapModule) -> app.module (bootstrap) -> app.component -> app.component.html -> index.html (`<app-root></app-root>` selector is used as an element to get the app component) -> The javascript files {runtime.js, polyfile.js, … etc } are responsible to make our application a single page and they are handled by the browser itself. But, the Html code should be available in our application itself.

- Google searching tips - cut the crap - Forget “what,” “how,” and other words that serve only a syntactical purpose. Demand answers using meaningful and descriptive verbs example - instead of 'what is algorithmic complexity' use 'define algorithmic complexity'. Order keywords from broad to specific, instead of 'consume an api using typescript with axios' use 'typescript axios consume api'. Use Images for Diagrams and Visualizations. Many times, Images will contain concise and informative graphics that will answer your question much faster than a web page could.
