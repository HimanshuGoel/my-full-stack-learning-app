- Keep camera on and give self introduction - My name is Himanshu Goel, and I am having over a decade of experience in full-stack development. From the past four years, I've been working with Sopra Banking on a low-code framework development. My journey began with the .NET technology stack, including ASP.net and C#. However, I soon transitioned into working with Angular.js and later versions of Angular (Angular 4+). Additionally, I have also worked in Node.js for creating RESTful APIs. Outside of work, I like to watch movies, reading books, writing blogs and playing video games during my free time

## Angular

- What is SPA and PWA?

- The @Injectable() providedIn property vs. @NgModule() providers array

- Why angular 2 and how is the author (Misko Hevery)?

- Angular key features with each version upgrade (angular 3 - version mismatch between @angular/core, @angular/compiler and @angular/router libraries, angular 4 - emphasis on making angular apps more faster, compact, faster compilation, better bug fixes alert, angular 5 - build optimizer, compiler improvements, internationalized number, date and currency pipes, @angular/http is deprecated and replaced with @angular/common/http, HttpModule replaced with HttpClientModule, angular 6 - angular elements, library support, tree shakable providers, angular 7 - cli prompts, virtual scrolling, drag and drops, bundle budgets in cli, angular 8 - differential loading by default where browser chooses between modern or legacy JS based on its own capabilities, dynamic imports for route configurations, web worker support, ng deploy added into cli, angular 9 - ivy compiler, new options for providedIn, component harnesses, youtube player and google maps components, angular 10 - date range picker component, optional stricter settings, angular 11 - fixed few popular bug fixes, automatic font inlining, hot module replacement, faster builds, TSLint deprecation, remove ie9, ie10 and ie mobile support, angular 12 - nullish coalescing support, deprecated support for IE11, angular 13 - dynamic components, accessibility improvements for angular material components)

- How do you do angular upgrade for your project

- Angular bootstrapping flow - When an Angular application is started, the main.ts file is loaded first, here we bootstrap the root module i.e. app.module.ts. In this module, we specify a component as the bootstrap component and tell angular to load this component and all its dependencies at start up and register it’s selector app-root. Now when browser loads the index.html file, it knows what is app-root and render all the contents of this component.

- Query decorator - @ViewChild, @ViewChildren, @ContentChild, @ContentChildren

- Difference between ng-container, div and span.

- SkipSelf and Optional attributes

- Interceptors - logging, auth token, readonly, busy, cache

- Three types of data bindings – interpolation, event binding, property binding. Interpolation is a one way data binding. Angular does not have built-in two way data binding, however, by combining property binding and event binding we can achieve two way data binding.

- Inbuilt structural directives are `*ngFor`, `*ngIf` and attribute directives are`NgStyle`and`NgModel`

- Types of guards – resolve, can activate, can activate child, can deactivate, and can load (can load is like can activate but it will not even go get the contents, html and the javascript until it get satisfied it is used in lazy loading).

- Module attributes - Bootstrap, Declaration, Exports, Import, Providers

- The useExisting and useFactory Providers

- Main files of build folder - The main.js file contains all the code in our application, the polyfills.js file loads all the polyfill script to make sure it can be compatible with all the modern browsers. The runtime.js loads all the other files. The styles.js file loads the styles as the name suggests and vendor.js file loads all the imported libraries.

- Zone, Tree shaking, Standalone component, APP_INITIALIZER

- Reactive vs. Template driven forms with typed form vs. untyped form

- Regarding - NG0100: Expression has changed after it was checked

- Interceptors which one you have used in which scenarios

- Route guards which one you have used in which scenario and route resolvers?

- Class based route guards vs. functional route guards (as inject() is available now in angular 14)

- Angular performance improvements - pipe, destroying observables, track by function, proper bundle settings, lazy loaded modules, webpack explorer

- JIT vs. AOT, Ivy vs. View engine, forRoot vs. forChild, Component vs. Directive, Pure and Impure pipe

- Ivy - TView, LView and RView - When Ivy does rendering, it needs to keep track of three kinds of data: Template, Logical Tree, and Render Tree. These three concepts are shortened for brevity as T, L, and R prefix in many of our data structures. The template is the parsed version of the source code. It contains instructions for rendering the template in the form of Ivy-instructions and metadata about the component/directive. Logical-view (LView) represents instances of a template (TView). We use the word “logical” to highlight how the developer thinks about the application from a logical perspective. A ParentComponent contains a ChildComponent. From a logical perspective, we think about a ParentComponent containing a ChildComponent, hence the “logical” designation. The render tree is the actual DOM render tree. It is different from the logical tree above in that the render tree must take content projection into account. Because of this parent/child relationship is not as straightforward as in the logical view.

- Transclusion / Content projection, Template reference variable

- The angular.json file settings like prefix, builder, build, test lint, output path, main, index, assets, styles, script, production budgets, vendor chunk, extract licenses, source map, named chunks

- Do you use angular cli, why the need of the angular cli tool?

- Async pipe

- Subject vs. Subject Behaviour

- Hot observables vs. cold observables

- Schedulers

- Examples of custom directive - password strength, external link, format text, debounce click, tooltip, copy to clipboard, input mask, read more/less, age input, role-based access control, feature toggle based on role/permission

- State management options – angular service, NgRx, ngrx-data, observable store, Akita, Ngxs, MobX.

- switchMap (cancelable requests - searches), concatMap (run in sequence, when order is important), mergeMap (run parallel, when order is not important), exhaustMap (like for login when we don't want to make more request until initial one gets completed)

- What are Angular directives - Component directives, Attribute directives, Structural directives

- What is an AOT compilation? What are its benefits? Improved performance, Smaller bundle size, Early error detection

- Define lifecycle hooks in Angular - ngOnChanges, ngOnInit, ngDoCheck, ngAfterContentInit, ngAfterContentChecked, ngAfterViewInit, ngAfterViewChecked, ngOnDestroy

- How do we generate a class in Angular using CLI? - ng generate class myStore

- Types of Control Value Accessor (like checkbox, radio, number, range, select)

## Angular Material

- View encapsulation modes – none, emulated and shadowDom.

- How angular view encapsulation avoid overriding the component style from external style.

- How to get even disable form controls values from form group. (getRawValue())

- Which new angular material component you have used?

- Virtual scrolling

- MDC-based components

- Secondary Entry Points

```typescript
// Earlier
import { MatButtonModule, MatCardModule } from '@angular/material';

// Now
import { MatButtonModule } from '@angular/material/button';
import { MatCardModule } from '@angular/material/card';

// One entrypoint:
// With secondary entrypoints:
```

## TypeScript

- Can you discuss the differences between synchronous and asynchronous programming in JavaScript, and explain when you would use each approach?

- console.log(1 + '1' - 1); // result: 11

- What is **proto**?

- Different loops - for, do-while, while, for-in, for-of, forEach

- Hoisting, Closure, Arrow functions, Symbols, Iterators, Generators, Map, Weak map, Set, Weak set

- Any patterns you have used like singleton, facade, pub-sub, revealing module pattern, factory, abstract factory, builder, prototype, adapter?

- Explicit binding – .call() or .apply(). The call() and apply() methods allows us to call a function and change the 'this' value, but sometimes we need to make a copy of the function and also change the this value, we can do this by 'bind()' method.

- Mutability vs. Immutability

- structuredClone() - deep copy vs. shallow copy

- Conditionally add property on a object -

```javascript
const a = {
  ...(someCondition && { b: 5 }),
};
```

- Conditionally add element on an array

```javascript
const fruits = ['a', 'b', ...(isSummer ? ['w'] : [])];
```

- Interface indexable types with template strings

```javascript

interface HeadersResponse {
    "content-type": string,
    date: string,
    "content-length": string,
    [headerName: `x-${string}`]: string
}

```

- What is the difference between readonly and const. The easiest way to remember whether to use readonly or const is to ask whether you’re using it on a variable or a property. Variables use const whereas properties use readonly.

- Callback vs. Promises vs. Async-Await vs. Observables

- Javascript Event loop

- Module formats - IIFE, Asynchronous Module Definition (AMD), CommonJS (CJS), Universal Module Definition (UMD), ES6 Modules. Non-native – AMD, common js, UMD, system.register. Native format – ES2015.

- Module loaders – AMD for require JS, for AMD, common JS, UMD and system.register we need SystemJS.

- Cache busting, Semantic versioning, package-lock.json file

- Why 0.2 + 0.1 != 0.3

- History of JS – at the national centre for super computing applications at the university of Illinois, there were couple of kids who were developing a client program for internet for number of protocols like WAIS, Archie, Gopher, FTB, Finger and WWW, they called this program MOSAIC. Finally, out of these protocols the WWW won, this format can also display image tag. A bunch of the people from that project were lured to California where they become part of a company called Netscape. Netscape made the first commercial web browser called Netscape navigator and it was a huge hit. For the new release of this navigator they also wanted to make it easy for end-user programming, they remembered something that had been on Macintosh called HyperCard, that was a simple application program based on a simple metaphor of stacks of cards and it was an event driven script thing and remarkably easy to use and they wanted something like that in the web browser. So, they gave this job to Brendan Eich, his idea was he would write a scheme interpreter to do this like he was told to do in a language like java or visual basic which people like and popular at that time, this if for the kids. He was given 10 days to create a prototype of this new interactive browser and in those 10 days he designed and implemented a new programming language which is an amazing achievement. So, from java he took syntax another language was scheme which is a dialect of LISP, scheme has lambdas i.e. functions, there is a dialect of small talk called Self it was having better performance and expressive, from Self he didn’t took the feature of classes, by removing classes they could make it much faster and much better to program. Netscape called this initial language as LiveScript. While this is going on another language that was being developed by a guy at Sun named Jim Gosling, they wrote a web browser in this language the browser called hot java, the language name was Java and become wildly successful. These both companies were working against Microsoft, so they form an alliance the first thing they agreed upon that Netscape adds java to the web browser in-exchange for that Sun will drop their hot java browser. Another thing is that they have to kill LiveScript as they were saying to the world that Java is the last programming language world ever need, but Netscape denied that because Java was not for beginners and they also wanted to launch the new browser right away and so the way they put Java in was they had Java talk to LiveScript through an interface called Live Connect. So, LiveScript could talk to the browser and java could talk to LiveScript through Live Connect. And if they took LiveScript out, Java wouldn’t work, so to save the alliance they change the name of language from LiveScript to javascript, and to showcase not a new language but as a subset to javas, interpreted java and they lied about the relationships of these two languages. Meanwhile after seeing this Microsoft had completely missed the web and the internet, they thought the future of telecommunications was going to be fax and cable TV. So they bought out a browser company, it was another spinoff out of Illinois called spyglass, took their thing and relabelled it as IE and decided that they also need one more thing related to JS. So, they reverse engineering the first JS engine. MS also noticed all the blunders, bugs, errors, design defects, MS carefully documents all of them and replicates them, they called it JScript. Then Netscape went to w3c to make the standard of their language, but w3c denied then they went to ISO, and then European computer manufactures association (ECMA), MS also joined this committee and dominates the committee. Also, MS told that all the bugs will remain in the standard, those standards where published by name ECMAScript.

- Object.create(null) - create an object that inherits nothing, not even from object.prototype. It will act much more like hash table.

## Unit Testing

- Benefits

- What is Test Harness?

- What is TestBed?

- Dependency injection?

- Testing structure types - AAA (Act, Arrange, assert), Behavioral (Given, When, Then)

- Styles of unit testing – output verification or functional verification, state verification, collaboration verification.

- Dummy vs. Stubs vs. Fake vs. Spy vs. Mock

- Test doubles – dummies like a placeholder, stubs objects that return predefined data, fakes slightly more realistic, mocks objects pre-programmed with expected outputs for given inputs and alsoD able to verify their calls, spies real object and verify interactions like mocks it is an hybrid of stubs, fakes and mocks.

- Marble testing is a technique where we draw marble diagrams using ACSII characters while writing unit test to visualize asynchronous observables behavior in a synchronous way. Benefits – readable code, test synchronously and helps to find out race condition in our code. Marble syntax - -, |, #, ^, !, a, ()

- debugEl with 'By' predicate vs. element.querySelector

- Have you used any e2e testing framework like cypress or protractor?

## HTML

- Semantic elements - header footer, section, nav, article, aside

- HTML 5 storage API – session (per origin and per instance, tied to domain origin) storage, local storage.

## CSS

- Block vs. inline elements

- Types of selectors - relational, attribute, structural, star selector

- Pseudo classes allow us to conditionally select an element based on state or position, they start with a colon (:) like :hover, :nth-of-type, :first-of-type, :last-of-type, :nth-child, :first-child, :last-child

- Specificity - id selector > class & attribute > type selector

- Z-index allows us to control the stacking order of the elements.

- Responsive web design using fluid grid, media queries, flexible images.

- 12 column grid layout and visual breakpoints

- Fallbacks and Polyfills – Fallback is to provide similar functionality as a native feature but maybe just with a different API. A Polyfills, on the other hand, is meant to replicate the exact same interface as well as functionality as how the native implementation would be built in the browser.

## Accessibility

- Have you considered Accessibility during your development?

- Web accessibility guidelines – WCAG (A, AA, AAA).

- aria attributes like aria-busy, aria-disabled, aria-grabbed, aria-hidden, aria-invalid.

- Largest Odd Number in String

```typescript

// Example 1
Input: num = "52"
Output: "5"
Explanation: The only non-empty substrings are "5", "2", and "52". "5" is the only odd number.

// Example 2:
Input: num = "4206"
Output: ""
Explanation: There are no odd numbers in "4206".

// Example 3:
Input: num = "35427"
Output: "35427"
Explanation: "35427" is already an odd number.

```

- Two Sum

```typescript

// Example 1:
Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].

// Example 2:
Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
Output: [1,2]

// Example 3:
Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6
Output: [0,1]
```

- Palindrome Number

```typescript

// Example 1:
Input: x = 121
Output: true
Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.

// Example 2:
Input: x = -121
Output: false
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.

// Example 3:
Input: x = 10
Output: false
Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.

```

- Roman to Integer

Symbol Value
I 1
V 5
