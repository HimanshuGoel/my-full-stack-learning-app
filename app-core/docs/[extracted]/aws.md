## Virtual Machine

- The early 2000s was the era of the virtual machine. We are now firmly in the container era. They have much smaller footprint, quicker to download and a lot less resource needed to run them.

## Container

- Container image â€“ a file system bundle containing all files, packages, dependencies, and kernel needed to run a service. To the host this is a single process. Container run isolated from other containers so software and dependencies installed on one container do not affect other containers. It has small footprint because there is no complete operating system with a container making them are much less resource hungry than running virtual machines.
