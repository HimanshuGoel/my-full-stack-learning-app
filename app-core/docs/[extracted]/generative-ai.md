# Extracted Notes - Generative AI

## Stable Diffusion

- Stable diffusion is a latent text-to-image diffusion model capable of generating photo realistic images given any text input. The model employs a technique called diffusion modelling, which works by incrementally reducing the noise in a sample over several iterations, eventually producing a final output. Diffusion model is a type of model that generates a chain of increasingly noisy images by adding Gaussian noise to an image and then training a model to predict the noise added to an image from one step to following one. It uses a fixed and finite number of steps to generate images, resulting in a stable repeatable image generation.

## LLM

- Local LLMs are advanced AI models that have been optimized to run on personal devices without the need for constant internet connectivity like GPT-2 Mobile, ALBERT, DistilBERT.
